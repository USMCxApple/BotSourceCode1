# BotSourceCode is a Source Code for my Discord Bot based on Java.
The bot uses Node.js, and Discord.js to connect to Discord's servers as a bot, it comes with many commands, i may expand the commands to include more moderation tools. 

As of right now, it is 100% ready to go, all you have to do is get your bot's token and replace the "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" in the token.json file.
